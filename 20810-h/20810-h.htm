<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE 
LADIES OF LLANGOLLEN.</h2>
<p>From the early age of Cambrian history, when the peerless beauty of the 
high-born Myfanwy Fechan awoke the passion and the poesy of her admiring 
bard, Howel ap Einion Llygliw, down to the modern days of the more humble, 
but not less renowned maiden, &ldquo;Sweet Jenny Jones;&rdquo; Llangollen, 
&ldquo;that sweetest of vales,&rdquo; seems to have been associated with 
recollections of tender and romantic interest.&nbsp; Our narrative, 
however, albeit it relates to the Ladies of Llangollen, refers not to 
whispered vows and moonlight serenades between gallant chiefs and damsels 
of noble birth; nor to sentimental tales of love in a cottage; but it is 
rather devoted to the records of a friendship, whose incidents and 
eccentricities have engaged the attention of many eminent <i>literati</i> 
and tourists.&nbsp; Most persons who take any interest in the scenery or 
topography of North Wales, have either seen or read of that singular <!-- 
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>residence, 
Plas Newydd, at Llangollen, for so many years the home of Lady Eleanor 
Butler and Miss Ponsonby.</p>
<p>About the year 1778, these ladies, impelled by a desire to lead a 
secluded life of celibacy, forsook the gay and fashionable circles in which
they had moved; and in their search for a fitting spot, on which to pass 
their days together in devoted friendship to each other, and in acts of 
benevolence and charity to their neighbours, they visited Llangollen.&nbsp;
Rambling along this charming locality one balmy evening, when the tranquil 
beauty of the lovely valley was lighted up by the mild splendour of the 
moon, their eyes rested upon a cottage that stood on a gentle eminence near
the village; and there they resolved to fix their abode.&nbsp; They 
accordingly purchased the estate; built a new cottage on the site of the 
old one, in a remarkably unique and somewhat grotesque style of 
architecture; and laid out gardens, pleasure grounds, and rural walks with 
grottoes, temples, conservatories, rustic bridges, and other accessories 
for enjoying, in the undisturbed quiet of their own domain, the natural 
charms of their picturesque retreat.&nbsp; Their mode of life being 
singular, and their costume still more so (for they assumed a style of 
head-dress resembling that of men, and always wore long cloth coats, rather
like ladies&rsquo; riding habits), they soon attracted the attention of the
many travellers who passed through North Wales; and as they kept up an 
extensive and active correspondence with several eminent authors <!-- page 
3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and persons of 
distinction, the &ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen,&rdquo; for so they were 
always designated, made a much greater sensation in their seclusion, than 
many less remarkable persons who are constantly living in the business and 
bustle of society.&nbsp; Hence many literary pilgrimages were made to the 
recluses of Plas Newydd; and the &ldquo;even tenor&rdquo; of their way was 
often diversified by the calls of the illustrious, the learned, and the 
curious; from whom they were as willing to learn what was passing in 
politics, literature, and general gossip, as were their visitors desirous 
of having a peep within the charmed circle of this mountain solitude.&nbsp;
Their motive for adopting this romantic seclusion is thus stated in 
&ldquo;Steward&rsquo;s Collections and Recollections:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby were young ladies of beauty
and rank, who loved each other with so true an affection, that they could 
never bear the afflicting idea of a separation, which the marriage of 
either might occasion.&nbsp; They therefore resolved on lives of celibacy, 
and refusing many handsome offers, and remaining deaf to the persuasions of
their friends, they retired to the beautiful Yale of Llangollen, to enjoy 
the happiness of each other&rsquo;s company, that as their friendship began
in infancy, it might be perpetuated through life.&nbsp; The traveller, in 
passing by the celebrated abode of these interesting women, must 
contemplate with a sigh that excessive friendship which could tear from the
bosom of society two of its brightest ornaments, to bury them in the depths
of seclusion:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>&lsquo;Full many a gem, of purest ray serene,<br />
&nbsp;  The dark unfathom&rsquo;d caves of ocean bear;<br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
&nbsp;  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is on this subject Miss Seward employs her poetical talents, 
in her well-known poem of &lsquo;Llangollen Vale.&rsquo;&mdash;The 
following is an account of these celebrated ladies, extracted from a 
periodical work published in the year 1796.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Butler and 
Miss Ponsonby are now retired from the society of men into the wilds (!) of
Llangollen in Wales, where they have resided seventeen years.&nbsp; Miss 
Butler is of the Ormond family, and had five offers of marriage, all of 
which she rejected.&nbsp; As Miss Ponsonby, her particular friend and 
companion, was supposed to have been the bar to her matrimonial union, it 
was thought proper to separate them, and Miss Butler was confined.&nbsp; 
The two ladies, however, found means to elope together, but being soon 
overtaken, were brought back to their respective relations.&nbsp; Many 
attempts were again made to draw Miss Butler into marriage, though in vain;
not many weeks after, the ladies eloped again, each having a small sum with
her.&nbsp; The place of their retreat was confided to a female servant of 
the house.&nbsp; Here they lived many years, unknown to any of the 
neighbouring villagers, otherwise than by the appellation of the 
&lsquo;Ladies of the Vale.&rsquo;&nbsp; No persuasions could ever get them 
from this retreat.&nbsp; A lady from Ireland told the collector of these 
articles the following anecdote relative to these female friends:&mdash;An 
<!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Irish 
nobleman (Lord Fingal) happening to be travelling in the neighbourhood of 
Llangollen Vale, and having heard much of Lady E. Butler and Miss Ponsonby,
felt a desire to see and converse with them.&nbsp; But how he could obtain 
this pleasure (as the ladies seldom or never saw company, and were fond of 
a recluse life) was the question.&nbsp; At length he bethought himself of a
method the most likely to answer the purpose, without the appearance of 
forwardness or indelicacy.&nbsp; He sent his servant with the following 
verbal message:&mdash;&lsquo;Lord Fingal, travelling in this neighbourhood,
sends his respectful compliments to Miss Butler and Miss Ponsonby, and 
informs them that he sets out to-morrow morning for Ireland, and would be 
happy to be the bearer of any commands of theirs to that 
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; This message had the effect which his lordship 
desired.&nbsp; He received, in return, a kind and friendly invitation to 
take tea with the ladies, which he, of course, accepted with much 
pleasure.&mdash;Lord Fingal (the collector&rsquo;s informant added) was 
peculiarly charmed with the amiable behaviour of these interesting 
enthusiasts of friendship.&nbsp; He found not in them the gravity, 
formality, and demureness of virgin recluses, but the ease of liveliness, 
and animated conversation of happy, cultivated, and polished 
minds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 2, 1829, death severed the faithful friendship which had existed
for so many years between the eccentric residents at Plas Newydd, by 
removing from this earthly scene Lady Eleanor <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Butler, who had attained 
the advanced age of 90; and in December 9, 1831, Miss Ponsonby, who was 
seldom seen (except by her domestics) after the decease of her attached 
companion, was called to her &ldquo;long home.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are both 
buried in the church-yard of Llangollen, where a stone monument is erected 
to their memory.&nbsp; On this record of mortality are inserted the 
following memorials:&mdash;</p>

the Sale at the Lion Hotel, Shrewsbury; the Inns at Llangollen, and Corwen;

the Chateau, extensive Library of Books, and all the valuable Appendages, 
will be submitted to Public Competition the latter End of the Month of 
July, by Direction of the Executors.</p>
<h3>PARTICULARS, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>Mr. ROBINS is not a little proud that it hath been his good fortune to 
be selected by the Executors of the Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby 
to direct the sale of their far-famed Domicile.&nbsp; He feels that an 
apology will be due to all those who are familiar with its beauties and 
peculiarities, for the very imperfect recital which follows, while those 
who are yet to be gratified with the sight of it, may imagine he has drawn 
some little upon &ldquo;Fancy&rsquo;s sketch.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing
of pretension in its outward form, it indicates but moderately the comfort 
that presides within, inasmuch as will be found congregated all the 
<i>agremens</i> pertaining to more consequential habitations.&nbsp; 
Considerable tact is conspicuous everywhere; but none more unequivocally 
displayed than in the lightsome little Dining Room, contrasted with the 
gloomy, yet superior grace of the Library, <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>into which it 
opens.&nbsp; This room is fitted up in the Gothic style, the Windows are of
ancient painted glass &ldquo;<i>shedding their dim religious 
light</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>THE SALOON OF THE MINERVAS</h4>
<p>Is the repository of the choice Library.&nbsp; The auxiliary Offices are
very commensurate, the grounds are disposed in such good order as is the 
natural consequence of pure taste, the Kitchen Garden is neatness itself, 
and the Fruit trees are of the rarest and finest sort, and luxuriant in 
their produce.&nbsp; Many and shaded</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">gravel walks encircle 
this elysium</span>,</p>
<p>Which is adorned with curious and rare Shrubs and Flowers.&nbsp; It is 
nothing in extent but</p>
<p style="text-align: center">EVERYTHING IN GRACE AND BEAUTY,</p>
<p>United with a great variety of foliage.&nbsp; Upon the Freehold is a 
considerable quantity of valuable Timber which overhangs</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">a deep and hollow 
glen</span>;</p>
<p>In its entangled bottom, a frothing brook leaps and clamours o&rsquo;er 
the rough stones in its channel towards</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE VALE OF LLANGOLLEN.</p>
<p>To speak of the latter would be quite superfluous, few, if any, are 
unacquainted with the wildness and surpassing beauty of the most admired 
spot in North Wales.&nbsp; Its contiguity to the little romantic village, 
giving the opportunity either to indulge in <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the gaiety of this 
place, or recreate in retirement, (as shall seem best suited to varied 
inclination), there are fortunately both auxiliaries to this scene (it had 
almost been said of enchantment).&nbsp; The verdant Lawns, dotted with rare
plants, the scenic beauties, and the woodland scenery combined, plead in 
extenuation of this lofty tone.&nbsp; The whole is encompassed by rich 
meadows, wearing a park-like appearance; held with the freehold, which is 
limited to less than Five Acres.&nbsp; A truly beautiful Portico of carved 
Oak leads to this</p>
<h4>DOMICILE OF COMFORT.</h4>
<p>The whole lower Story of which, on the outside, is covered with the 
richest carved Oak, and within which will be found a Dining Room 15 feet by
15, with handsome Chimney Piece, and carved Oak Doors and Wainscoting.</p>
<p>A Library, 13 feet by 14 feet 6 inches, with Three Gothic Windows of 
carved Oak and splendid stained Glass, exhibiting old Armorial Bearings, 
and forming a Bow Window, handsome Chimney Piece of yellow and white 
marble, and Recesses fitted up with Gothic Book Cases, and the Doors and 
Architrave of old carved Oak.</p>
<p>An admirably constructed Kitchen, carved Oak Doors and Window Facia, a 
very handsome carved Oak Screen and Seat, Grate Ovens, Hearths, Stew Holes,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>A Housekeeper&rsquo;s Room, beautifully fitted up with carved Oak 
Presses, Oak Doors and Window Frames.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>A 
large Larder with fixed Tables, Hooks, &amp;c. together with an ample 
Cellar, both so situated as to be perfectly cool in the hottest 
weather.</p>
<p>Wash-house, Scullery, Coal-house, &amp;c., a Staircase of carved Oak, 
Walls and Ceilings of the same beautifully ornamented Gothic 
Architecture.&nbsp; This is one of the most beautiful things that can be 
conceived.</p>
<h4>FIRST FLOOR.</h4>
<p>An excellent Bed Room, fixed Book Shelves and carved Oak Door, Chimney 
Piece and Window Facia, an excellent best Bed Room, Oak Doors, fancy 
Cornice, and cross Ceiling Beams of carved Oak, a very handsome Chimney 
Piece of the same.</p>
<p>A light Dressing Room and Closet, Gothic carved Oak Doors, &amp;c. 
fitted up with Book Shelves.&nbsp; Over the Staircase a commodious Pantry, 
Shelves and Presses for China and Plate, Oak Doors of carved open 
work.&nbsp; The Sashes of the Windows are all Metal.</p>
<h4>ATTIC STORY.</h4>
<p>Two good Servants&rsquo; Rooms, and a Store Room.&nbsp; The Premises 
consist of</p>
<h4>FOUR GARDENS</h4>
<p>In the best order, and well stocked with all kinds of Fruit Trees, 
Vegetables, and Flowers.</p>
<h4>FIVE PASTURE FIELDS</h4>
<p>Of the richest Land, well timbered, Rustic Bridges, Summer Houses of 
richly carved Oak, and Rustic <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Seats, Cow and Calf-house, Garden-house, Yard, 
Store-house, &amp;c.&nbsp; An excellent Engine Pump.</p>
<p>This celebrated Place was the Property, and for more than half a Century
the Residence of the late <span class="smcap">Lady</span> ELEANOR BUTLER 
<span class="smcap">and Miss</span> PONSONBY.&nbsp; It is situated upon a 
Piece of rich Table Land, just above the Port and Market-town of 
Llangollen, and commands a View of the Valley of the Dee, both up and down,
is close to Valle Crucis, Dinas Br&acirc;n, and many of the most beautiful 
Scenes in Wales.&nbsp; The Taxes are very light.</p>

<p>The exaggerated style of this ornate announcement will, doubtless, 
excite a smile, and we suspect that some of our readers, who know the 
locality, will laugh outright at the very fanciful stretch of imagination, 
which led the worthy auctioneer to speak of the &ldquo;<i>Port</i> of 
Llangollen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purchasers of the property were Miss Lolly and Miss Andrew, the 
present owners and occupiers of Plas Newydd, between whom and the late 
&ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen,&rdquo; an intimate friendship existed.</p>
<p>In August 1832, Mr. Robins offered by public auction the furniture and 
fittings of this unique villa; the following is a copy of the 
advertisement, and the catalogue of the sale extended over seventy quarto

<p>The present occupiers were also purchasers of many of the rare 
&ldquo;curiosities and relics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to cite the descriptions which have been put upon 
record by several distinguished and popular authors, relative to the 
&ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears from Volume VI. of the published Letters of the late Miss 
Anna Seward, that a friendly intimacy was cultivated between that clever 
<i>literateur</i> and the recluses of Plas Newydd; and it would seem from 
her correspondence, that their tastes were very comprehensive and 
multifarious; poetry and politics, music and mystery, tragedy and tattle, 
being alike acceptable.&nbsp; In a letter addressed to Lady Eleanor Butler 
and Miss Ponsonby, under date Lichfield, October 4, 1802, Miss Seward 
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! dearest ladies, it is under the pressure of a severe cold, 
fierce cough, and inflamed lungs, that I address you.&nbsp; A duty so 
delightful had, but for this incapacitating malady, been earlier paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank dear Miss Ponsonby for a manuscript <!-- page 
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of many verses,
which she had the goodness to make for me in hours so engrossed, amid 
engagements so indispensable.&nbsp; I had the honour to receive it as I was
stepping into the chaise which was to convey Mrs. Smith and myself far from
that Edenic region where we had recently passed so many happy hours; from 
those bowers in Llangollen Vale, whence the purest pleasures have so often 
flowed to my heart and mind, as from a full and overflowing 
fountain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Lichfield, Nov. 9, 1802, Miss Seward discourses to Miss Ponsonby on
modern tragedy, and concludes with the following bit of 
&ldquo;blue-stocking gossip:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Though I know her not, I am pleased that Mrs. Spencer has had the
good fortune to interest and delight you; for I am always desirous that men
of genius should not do what they are so prone to do, marry every-day 
women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naughty brook, for having behaved outrageously again!&nbsp; That 
little stream of the mountain is a true spoiled child, whom we love the 
better for its faults, and for all the trouble and alarm they 
occasion.&nbsp; You see I presume to involve myself, as if, in some sort, 
the interesting little virago belonged to me.&nbsp; Certainly it is my 
peculiar pet amongst your scenic children, dear to my taste, as they are 
beautiful; to my heart as being yours.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from Lichfield, June 13, 1805, Miss Seward 
begins:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With a trembling hand, my beloved Miss Ponsonby, <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>do I take up 
the pen to thank you for a thrice kind letter.&nbsp; It had not remained 
several weeks unacknowledged, but for this terrible malady of the head, 
which has oppressed me with so much severity during the interim.&nbsp; I 
think it must soon lay me low.&nbsp; Not at my time of life does the 
constitution, pushed from its equipoise by long enduring disease, regain it
amid the struggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately on receiving your last, I sent for Madoc; by far the 
most captivating work of its genuinely inspired author.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same letter the following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our young friend Cary has published his translation of 
Dante&rsquo;s Inferno.&nbsp; It is thought the best which has appeared, and
the sale goes on well.&nbsp; He presents a copy to yourself and Lady 
Eleanor, and I trust you will receive it soon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some literary disquisitions on the Inferno, the Lay of the Last 
Minstrel, and Madoc; and an allusion to King George&rsquo;s visit to 
Lichfield, the letter thus concludes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Present me devoutly to your beloved Lady Eleanor.&nbsp; Most 
interesting is your description of that visit, mutually paid to that 
desolate and silent Dinbren.&nbsp; How worthy of yourselves that hour of 
consecration, with all its tributary sighs!&nbsp; Too happy were the days 
and weeks which I passed beneath its roof, and in its beautiful and sublime
environs, to permit such revisitation from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would break my heart amid its present consciousness, <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>spread over 
with a dark and impervious pall, which can never be drawn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, and amiable Miss Ponsonby, farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Lichfield, October 31st, 1805, we have another letter to Miss 
Ponsonby, with the following tremendous opening:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear Madam, is so common as hypocrisy and treachery 
where property is concerned; but a greater excess of them never poured 
their dark currents from the vulgar heart, than in those circumstances 
which your last letter narrates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus ever be extortionate villany baffled&mdash;and long 
unclouded be the peace which succeeds to that attempted injury.&nbsp; I 
cannot express how much I am obliged that you took the kind trouble of 
retracing the road of peril, which had so nearly engulfed a scene, whose 
beauties rise perpetually in my sleeping and waking dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What ever could have happened at Plas Newydd to excite so grand a burst 
of tragic passion: here <i>is</i> matter for curious speculation!&nbsp; 
Then Miss Seward runs into a not very wise dissertation on politics; then 
reverts to literary subjects, of which Horace Walpole&rsquo;s genius is the
chief topic; bemoans her own dizziness of the head; has another touch at 
Mr. Pitt; and finally ejaculates &ldquo;Adieu, dearest Madam!&nbsp; Your 
beloved Lady Eleanor will accept my affectionate devoirs!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why 
did not Miss Seward go to Llangollen, to end her days in peace?</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>In
the lively Memoirs of that celebrated Comedian, the late Mr. Charles 
Matthews, we have the following humourous letters, descriptive of the 
&ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Oswestry, Sept. 4th. 1820.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear inseparable inimitables, Lady Butler and Miss Ponsonby, 
were in the boxes here on Friday.&nbsp; They came twelve miles from 
Llangollen, and returned, as they never sleep from home.&nbsp; Oh, such 
curiosities!&nbsp; I was nearly convulsed.&nbsp; I could scarcely get on 
for the first ten minutes after my eye caught them.&nbsp; Though I had 
never seen them, I instantaneously knew them.&nbsp; As they are seated, 
there is not one point to distinguish them from men: the dressing and 
powdering of the hair; their well-starched neckcloths; the upper part of 
their habits, which they always wear, even at a dinner-party, made 
precisely like men&rsquo;s coats; and regular black beaver men&rsquo;s 
hats.&nbsp; They looked exactly like two respectable superannuated old 
clergymen; one the picture of Boruwlaski.&nbsp; I was highly flattered, as 
they never were in the theatre before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The packets now sail at seven in the morning; all <i>day</i>-work
instead of night, which is delightful; and the weather is heavenly.&nbsp; 
People are here extremely hospitable; but, of all days in the year, Mr. 
Ormsby Gore went to Carnarvon assizes (being high sheriff) the day before I
arrived.&nbsp; He only returned yesterday; and almost forced me away from 
the inn.&nbsp; I, however, could not conveniently <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>go there, but have been
to call this morning.&nbsp; Such a place!</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by, have you any magnolias in the grounds? if not, get me 
one or two.&nbsp; I saw a Portugal laurel, only four years old, full half 
the size of that great beauty at Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s; pray have one or 
two of them placed by themselves on our new lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to-day received an invitation to call, if I have time as I
pass, at Llangollen, to receive in due form, from the dear old gentlemen 
called Lady Butler and Miss Ponsonby, their thanks for the entertainment I 
afforded them at the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Porkington, Oct. 24th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have seen them, heard them, touched them.&nbsp; The pets,
&ldquo;<i>the ladies</i>,&rdquo; as they are called, dined here 
yesterday&mdash;Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby, the curiosities of 
Llangollen mentioned by Miss Seward in her letters, about the year 
1760.&nbsp; I mentioned to you in a former letter the effect they produced 
upon me in public, but never shall I forget the first burst yesterday upon 
entering the drawing-room: to find the dear antediluvian darlings, attired 
for dinner in the same manified dress, with the Croix de St. Louis, and 
other orders, and myriads of large brooches, with stones large enough for 
snuff-boxes, stuck in their starched neckcloths!&nbsp; I have not room to 
describe their most fascinating persons.&nbsp; I have an invitation from 
them, which I much fear I cannot accept.&nbsp; They <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>returned home last 
night, fourteen miles, after twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; They have not 
slept one night from home for above forty years.&nbsp; I longed to put Lady
Eleanor under a bell-glass, and bring her to Highgate for you to look 
at.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 1825, Sir Walter Scott visited Llangollen, and the account of 
his interview with the famed &ldquo;ladies of the vale,&rdquo; is given 
with much humour and smartness by Mr. Lockhart, in his interesting Memoirs 
of the immortal &ldquo;Author of Waverley.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our progress through North Wales produced nothing worth 
recording, except perhaps the feeling of delight which everything in the 
aspect of the common people, their dress, their houses, their gardens, and 
their husbandry, could not fail to call up in persons who had just been 
seeing Ireland for the first time; and a short visit (which was, indeed, 
the only one he made) to the far-famed &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; of 
Llangollen.&nbsp; They had received some hint that Sir Walter meant to pass
their way; and on stopping at the inn, he received an invitation so 
pressing, to add one more to the long list of the illustrious visitors of 
their retreat, that it was impossible for him not to comply.&nbsp; We had 
read histories and descriptions enough of these romantic spinsters, and 
were prepared to be well amused; but the reality surpassed all 
expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extract from a gossiping letter of the following week will 
perhaps be sufficient for Llangollen.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Elleray, August 24.</p>
<p>* * * &ldquo;&lsquo;We slept on Wednesday evening at Capel Curig, which 
Sir W. supposes to mean the Chapel of the Crags; a pretty little inn in a 
most picturesque situation certainly, and as to the matter of toasted 
cheese, quite exquisite.&nbsp; Next day we advanced through, I verily 
believe, the most perfect gem of a country eye ever saw, having almost all 
the wildness of Highland backgrounds, and all the loveliness of rich 
English landscape nearer us, and streams like the purest and most babbling 
of our own.&nbsp; At Llangollen your papa was waylaid by the celebrated 
&lsquo;Ladies&rsquo;&mdash;viz. Lady Eleanor Butler and the Honourable Miss
Ponsonby, who having been one or both crossed in love, forswore all dreams 
of matrimony in the heyday of youth, beauty, and fashion, and selected this
charming spot for the repose of their now time-honoured virginity.&nbsp; It
was many a day, however, before they could get implicit credit for being 
the innocent friends they really were, among the people of the 
neighbourhood; for their elopement from Ireland had been performed under 
suspicious circumstances; and as Lady Eleanor arrived here in her natural 
aspect of a pretty girl, while Miss Ponsonby had condescended to accompany 
her in the garb of a smart footman in buckskin breeches, years and years 
elapsed ere full justice was done to the character of their romance. <a 
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp;
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>We 
proceeded up the hill, and found everything about them and their habitation
odd and extravagant beyond report.&nbsp; Imagine two women, one apparently 
seventy, the other sixty-five, dressed in heavy blue riding habits, 
enormous shoes, and men&rsquo;s hats, with their petticoats so tucked up, 
that at the first glance of them, fussing and tottering about their porch 
in the agony of expectation, we took them for a couple of hazy or crazy old
sailors.&nbsp; On nearer inspection they both wear a world of brooches, 
rings, &amp;c., and Lady Eleanor positively <i>orders</i>&mdash;several 
stars and crosses, and a red ribbon, exactly like a K.C.B.&nbsp; To crown 
all, they have crop heads, shaggy, rough, bushy, and as white as snow, the 
one with age alone, the other assisted by a sprinkling of powder.&nbsp; The
elder lady is almost blind, and every way much decayed; the other, the 
ci-devant groom, in good preservation.&nbsp; But who could paint the 
prints, the dogs, the cats, the miniatures, the cram of cabinets, clocks, 
glass-cases, books, bijouterie, dragon-china, nodding mandarins, and 
whirligigs of every shape and hue&mdash;the whole house outside and in (for
we must see everything to the dressing-closets), <i>covered</i> with carved
oak, very rich and fine some of it&mdash;and the illustrated copies of Sir 
W.&rsquo;s poems, and the joking simpering compliments about Waverley, and 
the anxiety to know who McIvor really was, and the absolute devouring of 
the poor Unknown, who had to carry off, besides all the rest, one small bit
of literal <i>butter</i> dug up in a Milesian stone jar lately from the 
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>bottom of some Irish bog.&nbsp; Great romance (<i>i.e.</i> absurd 
innocence of character) one must have looked for; but it was confounding to
find this mixed up with such eager curiosity, and enormous knowledge of the
tattle and scandal of the world they had so long left.&nbsp; Their tables 
were piled with newspapers from every corner of the kingdom, and they 
seemed to have the deaths and marriages of the antipodes at their 
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; Their albums and autographs, from Louis XVIII. 
and George IV., down to magazine poets and quack-doctors, are a 
museum.&nbsp; I shall never see the spirit of blue-stockingism again in 
such perfect incarnation.&nbsp; Peveril won&rsquo;t get over their final 
kissing match for a week.&nbsp; Yet it is too bad to laugh at these good 
old girls; they have long been the guardian angels of the village, and are 
worshipped by man, woman, and child about them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July, 1828, the charming vale of Llangollen was visited by a German 
Prince (Puckler-Muskau of Prussia), who has thus left on record the 
impressions which his excursion in that vicinity excited:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The most beautiful reality, however, awaited me this morning in 
Wales.&nbsp; The vision of clouds seemed to have been the harbinger of the 
magnificence of the vale of Llangollen,&mdash;a spot which, in my opinion, 
far surpasses all the beauties of the Rhine-land, and has, moreover, a 
character quite its own, from the unusual forms of the peaked tops, and 
rugged declivities of its mountains.&nbsp; The Dee, a rapid stream, winds 
through the green valley in <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>a thousand fantastic bendings, overhung with 
thick underwood.&nbsp; On each side high mountains rise abruptly from the 
plain, and are crowned with antique ruins, modern country-houses, 
manufactories, whose towering chimneys send out columns of thick smoke, or 
with grotesque groups of upright rocks.&nbsp; The vegetation is everywhere 
rich, and hill and vale are filled with lofty trees, whose varied hues add 
so infinitely to the beauty and picturesque effect of a landscape.&nbsp; In
the midst of this luxuriant nature, arises, with a grandeur heightened by 
contrast, a single long, black, bare range of mountains, clothed only with 
thick, dark heather,&rdquo; and from time to time skirting the high 
road.&nbsp; This magnificent road, which from London to Holyhead, is as 
even as a &lsquo;parquet,&rsquo; here runs along the side of the left range
of mountains, at about their middle elevation and following all their 
windings; so that in riding along at a brisk trot or gallop, the traveller 
is presented at every minute with a completely new prospect; and without 
changing his position, overlooks the valley now before him, now behind, now
at his side.&nbsp; On one side is an aqueduct of twenty-five slender 
arches, a work which would have done honour to Rome.&nbsp; Through this a 
second river is led over the valley and across the Dee, at an elevation of 
an hundred and twenty feet above the bed of the natural stream.&nbsp; A few
miles further on, the little town of Llangollen offers a delightful resting
place, and is deservedly much resorted to.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
30</span>&ldquo;There is a beautiful view from the churchyard near the inn:
here I climbed upon a tomb, and stood for half an hour enjoying with deep 
and grateful delight the beauties so richly spread before me.&nbsp; 
Immediately below me bloomed a terraced garden, filled with vine, 
honeysuckle, rose, and a hundred gay flowers, which descended to the very 
edge of the foaming stream.&nbsp; On the right hand, my eye followed the 
crisped waves in their restless murmuring course through the overhanging 
thicket; before me rose two lines of wood, divided by a strip of 
meadow-land filled with grazing cattle; and high above all, rose the bare 
conical peak of a mountain crowned by the ruins of the old Welsh castle 
Dinas Br&acirc;n, or the Crow&rsquo;s Fortress.&nbsp; On the left, the 
stone houses of the town lie scattered along the valley; the river forms a 
considerable waterfall near the picturesque bridge, while three colossal 
rocks rise immediately behind it like giant guards, and shut out all the 
more distant wonders of this enchanting region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I left Llangollen I recollected the two celebrated ladies 
who have inhabited this valley for more than half a century, and of whom I 
had heard once as a child, and again recently in London.&nbsp; You have 
doubtless heard your father talk of them;&mdash;&lsquo;si non, voil&agrave;
leur histoire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fifty-six years ago, two young, pretty and 
fashionable ladies, Lady Eleanor Butler, and the daughter of the late Lord 
Ponsonby, took it in their heads to hate men, to love only each other, and 
to live from that hour <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>in some remote hermitage.&nbsp; The resolution 
was immediately executed; and from that time neither lady has ever passed a
night out of their cottage.&nbsp; On the other hand, no one who is 
presentable travels in Wales unprovided with an introduction to them.&nbsp;
It is affirmed that the &lsquo;scandal&rsquo; of the great world interests 
them as much as when they lived in it; and that their curiosity to know 
what passes has preserved all its freshness.&nbsp; I had compliments to 
deliver to them from several ladies, but I had neglected to furnish myself 
with a letter.&nbsp; I therefore sent my card, determined if they declined 
my visit, as I was led to fear, to storm the cottage.&nbsp; Here, as 
elsewhere, however, in England, a title easily opened the door, and I 
immediately received a gracious invitation to a second breakfast.&nbsp; 
Passing along a charming road, through a trim and pretty pleasure-ground, 
in a quarter of an hour I reached a small but tasteful gothic cottage, 
situated directly opposite to Dinas Bran, various glimpses of which were 
visible through openings cut in the trees.&nbsp; I alighted, and was 
received at the door by the two ladies.&nbsp; Fortunately I was already 
prepared by hearsay for their peculiarities; I might otherwise have found 
it difficult to repress some expression of astonishment.&nbsp; Imagine two 
ladies, the eldest of whom, Lady Eleanor, a short robust woman, begins to 
feel her years a little, being now eighty-three; the other, a tall and 
imposing person, esteems herself still youthful, being only 
seventy-four.&nbsp; Both wore their still abundant hair <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>combed straight back 
and powdered, a round man&rsquo;s hat, a man&rsquo;s cravat and waistcoat, 
but in the place of &lsquo;inexpressibles,&rsquo; a short petticoat and 
boots: the whole covered by a coat of blue cloth, of a cut quite 
peculiar,&mdash;a sort of middle term between a man&rsquo;s coat and a 
lady&rsquo;s riding-habit.&nbsp; Over this, Lady Eleanor wore, first, the 
grand cordon of the order of St. Louis across her shoulder; secondly, the 
same order around her neck; thirdly, the small cross of the same in her 
button-hole, and &lsquo;pour comble de gloire,&rsquo; a golden lily of 
nearly the natural size, as a star,&mdash;all, as she said, presents of the
Bourbon family.&nbsp; So far the whole effect was somewhat ludicrous.&nbsp;
But now, you must imagine both ladies with that agreeable 
&lsquo;aisance,&rsquo; that air of the world of the &lsquo;ancien 
regime,&rsquo; courteous and entertaining, without the slightest 
affectation; speaking French as well as any Englishwoman of my 
acquaintance; and above all, with that essentially polite, unconstrained, 
and simply cheerful manner of the good society of that day, which, in our 
serious hardworking age of business, appears to be going to utter 
decay.&nbsp; I was really affected with a melancholy sort of pleasure in 
contemplating it in the persons of the amiable old ladies who are among the
last of its living representatives; nor could I witness without lively 
sympathy the unremitting, natural and affectionate attention with which the
younger treated her somewhat infirmer friend, and anticipated all her 
wants.&nbsp; The charm of such actions lies chiefly in the manner in which 
they <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>are performed,&mdash;in things which appear small and 
insignificant, but which are never lost upon a susceptible heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began by saying that I esteemed myself fortunate in being 
permitted to deliver to the fair recluses the compliments with which I was 
charged by my grandfather, who had had the honour of visiting them fifty 
years ago.&nbsp; Their beauty indeed they had lost, but not their memory: 
they remembered the C--- C--- very well, immediately produced an old 
memorial of him, and expressed their wonder that so young a man was dead 
already.&nbsp; Not only the venerable ladies, but their house, was full of 
interest; indeed it contained some real treasures.&nbsp; There is scarcely 
a remarkable person of the last half century who has not sent them a 
portrait or some curiosity or antique as a token of remembrance.&nbsp; The 
collection of these, a well-furnished library, a delightful situation, an 
equable, tranquil life, and perfect friendship and union,&mdash;these have 
been their possessions; and if we may judge by their robust old age and 
their cheerful temper, they have not chosen amiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the summer of 1833, Miss Catherine Sinclair, the clever authoress
of &ldquo;Modern Accomplishments,&rdquo; made an excursion through Wales, 
and thus describes her visit to Plas Newydd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No eyes but those of a poet are worthy to behold the celebrated 
valley of Llangollen, where we next proceeded, after having drawn largely 
on the firm of Messrs. Wordsworth, Cowper, Thomson, and <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Co. for language to pay
a due tribute of admiration to this surpassing scene,&mdash;but who has a 
genius equal to the majesty of nature?&nbsp; I thought of the Mahometan who
turned back when he observed some such rich and fertile plain, saying, he 
had been only promised one Paradise, and did not wish to enjoy it upon 
earth.&nbsp; Instead of following his example, however, we advanced, trying
to fancy ourselves on the banks of the Rhine, to which so many travellers 
have compared this beautiful valley.&nbsp; Pray employ your unrivalled 
taste in imagining the rugged mountains,&mdash;the sparkling 
river,&mdash;the ancient trees,&mdash;the smiling cottages,&mdash;the 
daisied meadows, and the fertile gardens, all grouped or scattered in the 
way you think best,&mdash;and invention can suggest nothing more 
perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The valley of Llangollen belonged once to the far-famed Owen 
Glendower, mentioned in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays, as &lsquo;not in the 
roll of common men.&rsquo;&nbsp; His palace stood near this formerly, and 
here he maintained a war during twelve years against Henry IV., being a 
keen adherent of Richard&rsquo;s; besides which, a private feud against 
Lord Grey de Ruthyn whetted his exertions.&nbsp; Peace was, however, about 
to be concluded in 1415, between the Welsh chief and the English king, on 
very honourable terms, when, as we frequently observe, if any one attains 
his utmost earthly desires, Owen died.&nbsp; But though the vale of 
Llangollen boasts of such a hero, its chief celebrity arises from a pair of
heroines; and we lost no time in doing homage <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to their memories, by 
scrambling our way up a steep ascent to that well-known cottage, where the 
late Lady Eleanor Butler and the Honourable Miss Ponsonby, during more than
half a century, devoted their long lives so romantically to friendship, 
celibacy, and the knitting of blue stockings.&nbsp; It seems only 
astonishing that this is so very rare an occurrence, for any one with a 
friend so richly endowed as my accomplished correspondent, might feel safe 
from the possibility of tiring, and might like to connect her name with so 
charming a scene and with so romantic a story.&nbsp; Two successors to 
these fair hermits have already sprung up, as substitutes for the original 
occupants, following the same exclusive plan of life; and in a moment of 
enthusiasm I felt much inclined to knock at the door and ask if they would 
make it a trio.&nbsp; In the case of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby,
very transient visits only were acceptable, and even their own names 
remained long concealed, as the friends eloped clandestinely without 
confiding to any one, except a maid servant, the place of their 
retreat.&nbsp; The cause of this very close seclusion having been variously
conjectured, excited much gossipping curiosity at the time; but from 
whatever cause the hermitage originated, here, embowered in roses, they 
&lsquo;made a solitude and called it peace.&rsquo;&nbsp; After discussing 
the Ladies of Llangollen, our thoughts naturally diverged into a general 
consideration, whether the greatest number of voluntary recluses have 
relinquished social intercourse <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>on account of disappointed affection, mortified
vanity, or mistaken devotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beau ideal of earthly felicity springs up to the 
imagination in taking a glance at the beautiful cottage of Llangollen! all 
the every-day vexations and vulgar cares of life, seem there swept aside, 
and nothing left for the inhabitants but to lead a life of graceful 
leisure, tying up carnations, engrafting roses, gazing at the splendid 
scenery around, and talking in perpetual ecstacies about flowers and 
perfumes.&nbsp; Almost every grown-up person entertains, at the out-set of 
life, notions of happiness with a cottage nearly similar to that which a 
little girl enjoys with her first doll,&mdash;dressing it up, altering, 
arranging, painting, and spoiling it; but this hermitage really is a 
singular looking toy.&nbsp; The building is long and low, so completely 
cased in richly-carved oak, that it might be mistaken for an enormous 
wardrobe.&nbsp; The garden slopes upwards from the river Dee, and is 
greatly embellished by a splendid beech hedge about forty feet high; 
several charming little summer houses are sprinkled about the grounds; and 
in one most romantic arbour, overlooking the fine cascade, we found a 
volume lying open on the seat, which proved to be Southey&rsquo;s Roderick;
suitable reading for such a scene of poetical beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An attempt at embellishment has been made, by placing a stuffed 
bear near the house, probably in imitation of the Zoological Gardens; but 
the idea is rather a failure, and would appear more suitable <!-- page 
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>over the door 
of a perfumer&rsquo;s shop, to intimate the presence of bear&rsquo;s 
grease.&nbsp; A little gim-crack model of a wooden house is also visible, 
by way of an ornament, stuck on the summit of a wooden pillar, but the 
effect is disproportioned to all surrounding objects, even more than the 
designs on Chinese paper; where men of six feet high are represented 
entering mansions half their own height, and birds may be seen flying 
larger than either the houses or their inhabitants.&nbsp; In a cottage 
built of oak and roofed with thatch, it would be very desirable that the 
inhabitants should have some taste for the study of entomology, as they 
might find an inexhaustible hunting-field among the wooden walls and 
creepers.&nbsp; It has been disputed whether more inconvenience is endured 
from the extreme cold of an English winter, or from the swarms of insects 
inevitably encountered during the heat of an Italian summer; but those who 
inhabit this &lsquo;Fairy Palace of the Vale,&rsquo; might be able from 
experience at home, to decide the question.&nbsp; They could afford 
sufficient employment for an entire pin-manufactory, to supply impaling 
machines for all the specimens of insects that might be collected and 
classified here.&nbsp; The birds too, were so vociferous, that we seemed 
standing in an aviary, and the locality would not at all have suited Lady 
---, who scolded her gardener for &lsquo;letting the sparrows make such a 
noise under her windows in the morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is much to be 
lamented how many &lsquo;harmonious blackbirds&rsquo; annually fall victims
to the preservation of cherries; <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and though the &lsquo;four-and-twenty baked in 
a pie,&rsquo; might be rather too loud when they all &lsquo;began to 
sing,&rsquo; yet a few in a garden are so enlivening and delightful, that 
it would be better never to taste fruit again than to lose such a concert 
of natural melody as we enjoyed at Llangollen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Roscoe, in his remarkably interesting &ldquo;Wanderings in North 
Wales,&rdquo; is less enthusiastic than some tourists on the subject of our
present narrative; he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Plas Newydd, for so many years the residence of the fair recluses
of the lovely vale of Llangollen, stands on a gentle eminence close to the 
town, ornamented with a carved railing in front, and decorated with 
grotesque gables and ornaments.&nbsp; The present proprietors are also two 
maiden ladies, who seem disposed to perpetuate the conventual celebrity of 
this place; and are certainly not less urbane than the former possessors, 
in permitting visitors to gratify their taste in the inspection of the 
beautiful grounds.&nbsp; Attended by my <i>cicerone</i>, the gardener, I 
passed from one object of natural beauty to another,&mdash;the vale of 
Pen-gwern surrounded by part of the Berwyn chain, the woody dingle, and 
brawling brook of the Cyflymed, with many others, which are supplied with 
the most gratifying conveniences for their leisurely inspection.&nbsp; 
After all, I must confess, filled as was my mind by the impressions of the 
majestic scenes with which it had become familiar, the miniature landscapes
supplied by the situation of Plas Newydd, fell far short of the 
anticipation <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>I had formed, and they forcibly recalled the emotion I remembered 
to have felt after viewing the mimic hills and vales, and passionless 
cascades of the poet Shenstone, in his retreat at the Leasowes, near 
Hagley.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Costello, who made the tour of North Wales in 1844 is even less 
complimentary, and is thus smartly satirical in the peculiarities of the 
departed &ldquo;Ladies:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One of the great attractions of Llangollen a few years ago was 
the romantic story attached to the place and the residence there of Lady 
Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp; Pilgrimages were made to this 
shrine of friendship, and the ladies were overwhelmed with visitors, and 
their cottage filled with offerings.&nbsp; Their tomb is now in the 
churchyard, and their cottage let; and very few persons recollect much 
about them, or feel any interest in a sentimental history, which belonged 
to the last century, and now can only excite a smile at the eccentricity of
its heroines, who, under pretence of retiring from society, made themselves
conspicuous throughout the country.&nbsp; Most of their accumulated stores 
were sold by public auction, on the death of the last of the friends, and 
the cottage, as it now stands, is by no means either a rural or picturesque
object.&nbsp; It is covered inside and out with carved wood, some of value,
and some quite worthless; and all that remains of the taste of the former 
proprietors merely proves how little was required to please fifty years 
ago.&nbsp; The trees, planted by the friends, are now <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>grown high, and shut 
out all view of the country; in fact, the whole place has a vulgar, 
common-place appearance, and excited in my mind no sort of interest, nor 
was my indifference agreeably dispelled by the view of an engraving, hung 
up in the little boudoir, representing the two ladies sitting at their 
table covered with curiosities, both dressed in masculine habits, and both 
frightfully ugly.&nbsp; These portraits, it seems, were taken by an 
amateur, by stealth, as neither of &lsquo;The Ladies of Llangollen&rsquo; 
would consent to sit, and a lamentable record is it which creates most 
unpleasing sensations to the lover of the graceful, beautiful, and 
venerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; were, although singular in the extreme, 
remarkably charitable and considerate of the necessities of their 
neighbours, and their loss has been greatly felt.&nbsp; They seemed vain 
and pompous, but accomplished and intellectual, and were a strange compound
of wisdom and folly, pride and condescension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The celebrated Madame de Genlis, in an entertaining miscellany, under 
the title of &ldquo;Souvenirs de Felicie L---,&rdquo; has given the 
following graphic narrative of &ldquo;The Fair Recluses of 
Llangollen:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;During my residence in England (says she), nothing struck me so 
much as the delicious cottage of Llangollen, in North Wales.&nbsp; It is 
not a little extraordinary, that a circumstance so singular and remarkable 
as that connected with this retreat, should hitherto have escaped the 
notice of all <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>modern travellers.&nbsp; The manner in which I became acquainted 
with it was this:&mdash;During our long-stay at Bury, a small company of 
five or six persons, including ourselves, met every evening from seven till
half-past ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We diverted ourselves with music and 
conversation, so that the time past very agreeably.&nbsp; One night 
friendship happened to be the subject of conversation, and I declared that 
I would with pleasure undertake a long journey to see two persons who had 
long been united by the bonds of genuine friendship.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, 
Madam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stuart (now Lord Castlereagh), go to Llangollen; 
you will there see a model of perfect friendship, which will afford you the
more delight, as it is exhibited by two females who are yet young and 
charming in every respect.&nbsp; Would you like to hear the history of Lady
Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It would give me the 
greatest pleasure.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I will relate it to 
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; At these words the company drew nearer to Mr. Stuart, we 
formed a little circle round him, and after recollecting himself a few 
moments, he thus began his narrative:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lady Eleanor Butler, was born in Dublin.&nbsp; She was 
left an orphan while in her cradle; and possessing an ample fortune, 
together with an amiable disposition and a beautiful person, her hand was 
solicited by persons belonging to the first families in Ireland.&nbsp; At 
an early age she manifested great repugnance to the idea of giving herself 
a master.&nbsp; This love of independence, which she never dissembled, <!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>did no 
injury to her reputation; her conduct has always been irreproachable, and 
no female is more highly distinguished for sweetness of temper, modesty, 
and all the virtues which adorn her sex.&nbsp; In tender infancy a mutual 
attachment took place between her and Miss Ponsonby, by an accident which 
made a deep impression on their imagination.&nbsp; They had no difficulty 
to persuade themselves that heaven had formed them for each other; that is,
that it had designed each of them to devote her existence to the other, so 
that they might glide together down the stream of life, in the bosom of 
peace, the most intimate friendship, and delicious independence.&nbsp; This
idea their sensibility was destined to realize.&nbsp; Their friendship 
gradually grew stronger with their years, so that at seventeen they 
mutually engaged never to sacrifice their liberty, or to part from each 
other.&nbsp; From that moment they formed the design of withdrawing from 
the world, and of settling for good in some sequestered retreat.&nbsp; 
Having heard of the charming scenery of Wales, they secretly absconded from
their friends for the purpose of fixing upon their future residence.&nbsp; 
They visited Llangollen, and there, on the summit of a mountain, they found
a little detached cottage, with the situation of which they were 
delighted.&nbsp; Here they resolved to form their establishment.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile the guardians of the young fugitives sent people after them, and 
they were conveyed back to Dublin.&nbsp; They declared that they would 
return to their mountain as soon as they <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>were of age.&nbsp; 
Accordingly, at twenty-one, in spite of the entreaties and remonstrances of
their relatives and friends, they quitted Ireland for ever, and flew to 
Llangollen.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby is not rich, but Lady Eleanor possesses a 
considerable fortune.&nbsp; She purchased the little hut and the property 
of the mountain, where she built a cottage, very simple in external 
appearance, but the interior of which displays the greatest elegance.&nbsp;
On the top of the mountain she has formed about the house a court and 
flower-garden; a hedge of rosebushes is the only enclosure that surrounds 
this rural habitation.&nbsp; A convenient carriage-road, the steepness of 
which has been diminished by art, was carried along the mountain.&nbsp; On 
the side of the latter some ancient pines of prodigious height were 
preserved; fruit trees were planted, and a great quantity of cherry trees 
in particular, which produce the best and finest cherries in England.&nbsp;
The two friends likewise possess a farm for their cattle, with a pretty 
farm-house and a kitchen-garden at the foot of the mountain.&nbsp; In this 
sequestered abode these two extraordinary persons, with minds equally 
cultivated, and accomplishments equally pleasing, have now resided ten 
years, without ever having been absent from it a single night.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless they are not unsociable, they sometimes pay visits to the 
neighbouring gentry, and receive with the greatest politeness travellers on
their way to or from Ireland, who <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>are recommended to them by any of their old 
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This account strongly excited my curiosity, and produced the same
effect on Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Orleans and my two young companions.&nbsp; 
We determined the same night to set out immediately for Llangollen, by the 
circuitous route of Brighton, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; It 
was the latter end of July when we arrived at Llangollen.&nbsp; This place 
has not the rich appearance of the English villages in general, but nothing
can equal the cleanliness of the houses, and among the lower classes of any
country this is an infallible proof of abundance.&nbsp; Llangollen, 
surrounded with woods and meadows, clothed with the freshest verdure, is 
situated at the foot of the mountain belonging to the two friends, which 
there forms a majestic pyramid covered with trees and flowers.&nbsp; We 
arrived at the cottage, the only object of our journey, an hour before 
sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two friends had received in the morning by a messenger the 
letter which Mr. Stuart had given me for them.&nbsp; We were received with 
a grace, a cordiality, and kindness, of which it would be impossible for me
to give any idea.&nbsp; I could not turn my eyes from those two ladies, 
rendered so interesting by their friendship and so extraordinary on account
of their way of life.&nbsp; I perceived in them none of that vanity which 
takes delight in the surprize of others.&nbsp; Their mutual attachment, and
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>their
whole conduct evince such simplicity, that astonishment soon gives way to 
softer emotions; all they do and say breathes the utmost frankness and 
sincerity.&nbsp; One circumstance which I cannot help remarking is, that 
after living so many years in this sequestered retreat, they speak French 
with equal fluency and purity.&nbsp; I was likewise much struck with the 
little resemblance there is between them.&nbsp; Lady Eleanor has a charming
face, embellished with the glow of health; her whole appearance and manner 
announce vivacity and the most unaffected gaiety.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby has a
fine countenance, but pale and melancholy.&nbsp; One seems to have been 
born in this solitude, so perfectly is she at her ease in it; for her easy 
carriage shews that she has not retained the slightest recollection of the 
world and its vain pleasures.&nbsp; The other, silent and pensive, has too 
much candour and innocence for you to suppose that repentance has conducted
her into solitude, but you would suppose that she still cherishes some 
painful regrets.&nbsp; Both have the most engaging politeness, and 
highly-cultivated minds.&nbsp; An excellent library, composed of the best 
English, French, and Italian authors, affords them an inexhaustible source 
of diversified amusement and solid occupation; for reading is not truly 
profitable except when a person has time to read again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interior of the house is delightful on account of the just 
proportion and distribution of the apartments, the elegance of the 
ornaments and <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>furniture, and the admirable view which you enjoy from all the 
windows; the drawing-room is adorned with charming landscapes, drawn and 
coloured from nature, by Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp; Lady Eleanor is a great 
proficient in music; and their solitary habitation is filled with 
embroidery by them both, of wonderful execution.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby, who 
writes the finest hand I ever saw, has copied a number of select pieces in 
verse and prose, which she has ornamented with vignettes and arabesques, in
the best taste, and which form a most valuable collection.&nbsp; Thus the 
arts are cultivated there with equal modesty and success, and their 
productions are admired with a feeling that is not experienced elsewhere; 
the spectator observes with delight that so much merit is secure in this 
peaceful retreat from the shafts of satire and envy, and that talents 
unaccompanied with ostentation and pride, have there never coveted any 
suffrages but those of friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening was a scene of enchantment for me; not one painful 
reflection disturbed its felicity.&nbsp; I retired to rest, but my 
imagination was so fully occupied with what I had seen and heard, that my 
thoughts kept me for a long time awake.&nbsp; At length, I was just falling
asleep, when I was roused by the most melodious sounds.&nbsp; I listened in
great astonishment; it was not music, but an indistinct and celestial 
harmony which penetrated my very soul.&nbsp; I discovered that it was 
produced by a violent wind which had just then arisen; my ear <!-- page 
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>distinguished 
the distant noise and the whistling usually heard on such occasions, but 
the winds changing their nature as they approached this asylum of peace and
friendship, formed only the most enchanting harmony as they met its trees 
and its walls.&nbsp; I was strongly disposed to believe in prodigies; but 
nevertheless I was determined to investigate the nature of this, but I 
durst not rise for fear of waking Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Orleans, who was 
extremely fatigued with her journey, and slept in a bed close by 
mine.&nbsp; The tempest suddenly ceased, and the harmonious sounds appeared
to be carried to a distance by the retiring winds.&nbsp; I raised my head 
towards the heavens to catch the last tones of this celestial concert, 
which seemed to be lost in the clouds.&nbsp; I listened with transport like
St. Cecilia; if I had had my harp in my hands I should certainly have 
dropped it; at that moment all terrestrial music appeared totally 
spiritless and insipid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning the whole mystery was explained.&nbsp; On opening my
window I found in the balcony an Eolian harp, an instrument with which I 
was then unacquainted, and which, when the wind blows upon it, produces 
such enchanting sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked out the whole forenoon with the two friends; nothing can
equal the charms of the surrounding scenery, and of the prospects which the
mountain whose summit they occupy commands; at this elevation they appear 
the queens of all the beautiful country at their feet.&nbsp; Towards the 
north <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>they have a view of the village and of a wood; to the south a long
river washes the foot of the mountain, and fertilizes meadows of prodigious
extent, beyond which is discovered an amphitheatre of hills, covered with 
intermingled trees and rocks.&nbsp; In the midst of this wild scenery rises
a majestic tower, which might be taken for the Pharos of this coast, but is
only the ruins of a magnificent castle, once the residence of the prince of
the country.&nbsp; This solitary region was doubtless at that time 
flourishing and populous, now it is abandoned to nature alone; nothing is 
now to be seen in it but herds of goats, and a few scattered herdsmen 
sitting upon the rocks and playing upon the Irish harp.&nbsp; Facing this 
rustic and melancholy scene the two friends have raised a verdant seat, 
shaded by two poplars, and thither they told me they often repair in summer
to read together the poems of Ossian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ride from Wrexham to Llangollen is remarkable for the 
sublimity and awful grandeur of the prospects; the most prominent feature 
in the landscape is a high and stupendous chain of mountains, sometimes 
swelling into the clouds, or gently shelving into the vallies, around which
they form a wide amphitheatre; and by their elevations afford shelter, and 
tend to fertilize the vales at their bases.&nbsp; I was led to 
exclaim&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love thy mountain&rsquo;s giant forms!<br />
&nbsp;  Darkly clad in gath&rsquo;ring storms;<br />
I love thy rocks, down whose steep sides,<br />
&nbsp;  With foaming, dizzying crash,<br />
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>Thunder the torrent&rsquo;s tan-brown tides,<br />
&nbsp;  And roaring whirlwinds dash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Mid clouds and crags, dark pools and mountains drear,<br 
/>
&nbsp;  The wild-wood&rsquo;s silence, and the billow&rsquo;s roll,<br />
Great Nature rules, and claims with brow austere,<br />
&nbsp;  The shudd&rsquo;ring homage of the inmost soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the craggy sides of the rocks descend the tributary streams 
to supply the river which divides the dales, and which dashes its foaming 
impetuous course along the banks, often edged with broken crags and grey 
rocks, or is seen winding in a deeper and more peaceful stream through dark
and silent groves, spreading their autumnal shades over the surface, or 
often glistening through fields of verdure and cultivated spots of ground; 
here foaming and chafing some dark ruin&rsquo;s tottering base, there 
reflecting the modern villa or the humble hamlet in its silver bosom, and 
by the variety of scenery giving new beauty to the whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cottages, bridges, villas, towers, rocks, and dark ruins of 
Gothic antiquity, are in unison with the surrounding objects, and the 
attention is frequently called from beholding the beauties of nature to 
pause on the works of art.&nbsp; In the centre of the long valley which 
stretches to Llangollen, is erected a most stupendous aqueduct, by which 
the canal is conveyed from a lofty hill over a wide chasm in the mountains;
the length of this amazing work of art and human industry, is, I was <!-- 
page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>informed, 
three hundred yards, the aqueduct composed of cast iron, is supported on 
fifty stone pillars and arches, and the view of this immense pile 
bestriding the valley is grand beyond description, and contributes much to 
heighten the effect produced by the whole scenery; for here grandeur and 
sublimity sit enthroned on the mountains, and solitude and human privacy, 
with their attendant charms, have fixed their abode in the vallies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauties of the Vale of Llangollen certainly exceed every 
idea I had formed of their grandeur, and on my arrival at the inn in the 
village, the muse embodied the following</p>
<p>&ldquo;LINES ON VISITING LLANGOLLEN.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much have I heard, Llangollen, of thy scenes,<br />
And the wild landscapes of thy mountain greens,<br />
The rushing streams, that dash thy rocks among,<br />
Thy snow-topt mountains, thy wild harper&rsquo;s song,<br />
Thy fruitful vallies deep, where oft between<br />
Rise hamlets, rocks, and tow&rsquo;rs to grace the scene.<br />
Where solitude and calm contentment dwell,<br />
And contemplation roves each rocky dell,<br />
Or climbs the snow-topt mountain&rsquo;s cloudy height<br />
To watch the sinking shades of evening light;<br />
To view the foaming torrent&rsquo;s misty shower,<br />
To list&rsquo; the brooding tempest&rsquo;s rising roar,<br />
Mark the blue mists the silvery moonbeams shroud,<br />
Or golden ev&rsquo;ning edge the dusky cloud;<br />
Yet, till this hour my doubting heart has thought<br />
Thy glowing scenes by fancy&rsquo;s pencil wrought,<br />
Or drest in poetry&rsquo;s enchanting hues,<br />
And all the flatt&rsquo;ring colours of the muse;<br />
<!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>But 
if in winter&rsquo;s storms thy beauties charm,<br />
If the cold breast thy varying landscapes warm,<br />
In summer&rsquo;s smiles it surely stands confest,<br />
That he who draws thee fairest paints thee best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having thus seen the various amusing and interesting records, which so 
many of our most popular authors have given to the world, respecting the 
once famous &ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen,&rdquo; curiosity induced us to pay
a visit to this much frequented abode of ancient friendship.&nbsp; 
Accordingly in March, 1847, we made an excursion, in company with our 
respected Publisher, to the celebrated retreat of Plas Newydd; and through 
the favour of Mr. Jacques, an intelligent and hospitable gentleman resident
at Pen-y-bryn, Llangollen, we were introduced to the present owners, Miss 
Lolly and Miss Andrew, and met with a most courteous reception.&nbsp; Their
manners are easy, dignified, and lady-like; totally free from all 
affectation, and in nowise marked by that frigid stateliness and pedantic 
formality, which a censorious world proverbially attributes to a state of 
elderly maidenhood.&nbsp; In all its characteristic particulars, the 
cottage remains in the same condition as in the days of Lady Eleanor and 
Miss Ponsonby; but its present possessors have introduced several judicious
alterations in the interior, which, though carried out in strict harmony 
with the general design of its former occupants, exhibit an improved taste 
and a cultivated judgment.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The house is delightfully situated, and is 
well-adapted to realize the notion of the poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pleasant from the loop-holes of retreat<br />
To look at such a world; to see great Babel<br />
And not feel the crush;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the site is not well chosen for developing the many charming 
prospects which the vale of Llangollen affords; and, indeed, the entire 
arrangements, both of dwelling and pleasure grounds, seem to be suggestive 
rather of another poetical maxim in great favour with anchorites and 
recluses&mdash;&ldquo;Retire, the world shut out.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot 
agree with Miss Seward, who describes this hermitage as &ldquo;a retreat 
which breathes all the witchery of genius, taste, and 
sentiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is rather fantastical than tasteful, and savours
more of eccentricity than sentiment.&nbsp; In the Gothic entrance, there 
are undoubtedly many fine specimens of carved wood-work, some of which we 
suspect were the plunder of despoiled convents and churches during the 
continental wars of the last century; but classical, mythological, and 
scripture subjects are intermingled in odd confusion, and with &ldquo;most 
admired disorder.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rooms are small and comfortable, with 
very low ceilings; the prospect from the dining-room is flat and tame; but 
several of the miniature views, as seen through small openings of the 
painted window in the library, are remarkably picturesque, and reveal 
themselves with a pleasing effect to the eye of the artist or the admirer 
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of 
natural scenery.&nbsp; The cottage yet contains many articles of furniture 
and choice rarities, which belonged to the former owners; whose portraits 
adorn the fanciful little boudoir.&nbsp; Disguised as they are by the 
strangeness of their costume, we should not like to hazard any opinion of 
our own as to their personal charms; especially as Miss Seward has been so 
minutely particular in telling us &ldquo;all about them.&rdquo;&nbsp; That 
clever and amusing gossip says of the &ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; whom she 
rhapsodizes as &ldquo;the enchantresses&rdquo; of Plas Newydd&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Eleanor is of middle height, and somewhat beyond the 
<i>embonpoint</i> as to plumpness; her face round and fair, with the glow 
of luxuriant health.&nbsp; She has not fine features, but they are 
agreeable; enthusiasm in her eye, hilarity and benevolence in her 
smile.&nbsp; Exhaustless is her fund of historic and traditionary 
knowledge, and of every thing passing in the present eventful period.&nbsp;
She expresses all she feels with an ingenuous ardour, at which, the 
cold-spirited beings stare.&nbsp; I am informed that both these ladies read
and speak most of the modern languages.&nbsp; Of the Italian poets, 
especially of Dante, they are warm admirers.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby, somewhat 
taller than her friend, is neither slender nor otherwise, but very 
graceful.&nbsp; Easy, elegant, yet pensive, is her address and manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;Her voice, like lovers&rsquo; watched, is kind and 
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A face rather long than round, a complexion clear <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>but without bloom, with
a countenance which, from its soft melancholy, has a peculiar 
interest.&nbsp; If her features are not beautiful, they are very sweet and 
feminine.&nbsp; Though the pensive spirit within permits not her lovely 
dimples to give mirth to her smile, they increase its sweetness, and, 
consequently, her power of engaging the affections.&nbsp; We see, through 
her veil of shading reserve, that all the talents and accomplishments which
enrich the mind of Lady Eleanor, exist, with equal powers, in this her 
charming friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We commend these pen and ink portraits to the notice of our readers 
without controversy; and the more especially, as they may gratify their 
curiosity still more in this matter, by purchasing from our Publisher a 
well-executed engraving representing, with all due fidelity, excellent 
likenesses of the &ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen;&rdquo; each, as 
<i>Hamlet</i> would say, &ldquo;in her habit as she lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the treasured relics which the cottage now contains, we were shewn
the veritable crutch-headed walking stick, on which Lady Eleanor used to 
support her aged steps, when rambling through the village on errands of 
mercy, or sauntering among the pleasure grounds of her mountain-home; and 
we also saw and handled the broad-brimmed hat worn by Miss Ponsonby, whose 
head we should judge to have been small and finely formed.&nbsp; O for the 
genius of a Seward, to have written an ode to that venerable head-dress! 
and in good truth, one might almost fancy we <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>heard the spirit of 
that amiable enthusiast, bidding us, like <i>Gesler&rsquo;s</i> captain, 
&ldquo;bow down and honour it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seriously, every little 
particular connected with the history and habits of the departed 
&ldquo;Ladies&rdquo; is so anxiously prized at Llangollen, that we felt 
very grateful for the prompt kindness with which the present worthy 
possessors of the unique residence contributed to our information and 
amusement.&nbsp; We may therefore tell, for the advantage of such of our 
readers as associate their notions of &ldquo;old maids&rdquo; with an 
affectionate regard for the canine and feline tribes, that Lady Eleanor 
Butler possessed a favourite dog of the turnspit-breed, called 
&ldquo;Trust;&rdquo; that Miss Ponsonby had a small white poodle, named 
&ldquo;Busy;&rdquo; and that they had a joint interest in a popular cat, 
answering to the name of &ldquo;Meggins;&rdquo; all of which four-footed 
domestics were especial pets in their garden walks or at their quiet 
fire-side.</p>
<p>The little domain of Plas-Newydd, if situated in some localities, would 
be esteemed a miniature paradise, but planted as it is amidst so many 
scenes of surpassing loveliness, its limited and somewhat formal 
characteristics suffer by comparison.&nbsp; The arrangement of the ground 
might have suited the peculiar tastes and habits of the 
&ldquo;recluses;&rdquo; but it is certainly very far inferior to the 
picturesque effect, which landscape gardening in the present day could 
<i>there</i> produce.&nbsp; The prettiest portions of these much-vaunted 
precints are the shady knoll, overhanging a romantic glen, <!-- page 
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>down which a 
brawling streamlet leaps its frothing course over a craggy bed; and the 
rural walk by the gothic fount, into which a pellucid mountain-rill pours 
its refreshing waters.&nbsp; Among the remembrances of former days, is the 
effigy of a guardian &lsquo;lion,&rsquo; (which, under the name of a 
&lsquo;bear,&rsquo; has been noted by an author whom we have quoted;) the 
melancholy quadruped is now considerably &ldquo;used up,&rdquo; and excites
a laugh at the burlesque on the monarch of the forest, which his attenuated
figure and shrivelled hide present.&nbsp; Plas-Newydd is unquestionably a 
delightful residence; and its adjacent pleasure grounds and gardens afford 
most inviting facilities for those who love to make a practical study of 
horticulture; to ruminate amidst its tranquil retreats over the published 
works of some favourite authors; or to &ldquo;meditate,&rdquo; like the 
patriarch, at &ldquo;even-tide&rdquo; on the wonders and glories of Eternal
Power.&nbsp; Apart therefore from the romantic recollections, with which 
the singular history of the &ldquo;Ladies of Llangollen&rdquo; has invested
this fair spot of earth, it presents to the tourist certain attractions, 
which the reflective explorer of the lovely vallies of the Dee should not 
neglect.&nbsp; We heard from some of the older inhabitants several 
anecdotes of the benevolence and charity of the departed 
&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; whose memory is most affectionately cherished in the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; It has been said that on religious subjects, these 
ancient friends were divided in opinion; one being a Roman Catholic and 
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the 
other a Protestant; but the parish clerk, an intelligent old man who knew 
them well, assured us that they both regularly attended the services in the
Church of Llangollen, and received the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s 
Supper, both there, and at their own cottage during the last illness of 
Lady Eleanor Butler, from the vicar.&nbsp; With all their eccentricity, 
their attachment to each other must have been of a pure, unchanging, and 
fervent character; else would they never have forsworn in the full bloom of
youth and beauty, the gay fascinations or the elegant ease of courtly life 
for the dull monotony of seclusion and celibacy.&nbsp; Both in feeling and 
intellect, Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby were no common persons; it
may of a truth be said of them, that &ldquo;they lived to a good old age 
and died honoured and respected;&rdquo; and if ever the beings of a 
brighter and holier sphere are permitted to cast back occasional glimpses 
on the world which they have left, their spirits may sometimes hover over 
the sacred spot where their ashes repose, and haunt the moon-lit banks of 
the silvery Dee, in its murmuring current by the lowly church-yard of 
Llangollen.</p>
<h2><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>VALLE CRUCIS ABBEY.</h2>
<p>The picturesque ruins of this venerable structure stand in a lovely and 
sequestered valley, about two miles from Llangollen, and are approached by 
as delightful and inviting road as ever rambler need wish to tread.&nbsp; 
The Rev. John Williams, in his learned description of this ancient 
monastery, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The abbey was founded about the year 1200, <a 
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a" class="citation">[58a]</a> 
and in conformity with the rule <a name="citation58b"></a><a 
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a> of the Cistercian 
fraternity, was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The names by 
which it was generally known to the Welsh had, however, a particular 
reference to the locality where it was situated: thus, &lsquo;Monachlog y 
Glyn,&rsquo; &lsquo;Monachlog Glyn Egwestl,&rsquo; &lsquo;Monachlog Pant y 
Groes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in Latin it was called &lsquo;Abbatia <a 
name="citation58c"></a><a href="#footnote58c" class="citation">[58c]</a> de
Valle Crucis,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Abbatia de Llanegwest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remains of the abbey extant at the present day consist of the
church, and of a building on the southern side, part of which seems to have
formed the Abbot&rsquo;s lodgings, and part to have been the refectory, 
with the dormitory above.&nbsp; The church is a cruciform building, of 
which the northern side <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>has been almost entirely destroyed, and without
any vestige remaining of its roof, except in the eastern aisle of the 
southern transept.&nbsp; In the midst of these hallowed precincts the 
rubbish is heaped up to a great height, caused, probably, by the fall of 
the northern wall, and by the remains of the roof:&mdash;the pavement, if 
there be any of it subsisting, is entirely concealed, and ash-trees grow 
luxuriantly upon the mounds, adding to the picturesque effect of the ruin, 
but saddening the heart of the antiquary.&nbsp; We are unable, therefore, 
to determine the number of piers that formed the side of the nave; but from
the space between the western end and the central piers, at the 
intersection of the transepts, we should conjecture this number to have 
been three, thus making four arches on either side.&nbsp; The choir was 
without aisles, but each transept had one on the eastern side, which seems 
to have been used as a chapel.&nbsp; The oldest portion of the church is 
the choir; the eastern end of which was lighted by three bold and lofty 
lancet arches, rising from no great height above the level of the pavement 
to half the altitude of the building, and by two proportionably smaller 
lancets above.&nbsp; In the apex of the gable was probably a small 
aperture, but of this no trace remains; the gable is mutilated, and we 
judge only from the analogy of the western end of the nave.&nbsp; In each 
of the northern and southern walls of the choir is a lancet window; and two
similar windows, but lower in height, occur in each of the eastern walls of
the transept aisles.&nbsp; High up <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>in the southern wall, 
also, is to be seen a small loophole, communicating with a passage which 
leads over the vaulting of the southern transept aisle to the abbatial 
building adjoining the church.&nbsp; This passage is now blocked up, but it
is conjectured to have served either as a closet wherein the abbot could 
attend service privately, or else as a place of confinement or penitence 
for the monks.&nbsp; The architecture of this portion of the church 
corresponds in its style with the date of the foundation,&mdash;the 
commencement of the thirteenth century: the lancets, with their mouldings, 
are strictly of that date, and the capitals of the shafts, which are worked
with great boldness, are of the late Norman period, rather than of that 
which is called Early-pointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all that portion of the nave which occurs between the central 
tower and the western end, nothing remains but the outer wall of the 
southern aisle; the western end of it, however, still stands, and is a 
beautiful example of the richest and purest architecture of the middle of 
the thirteenth century.&nbsp; Over a central doorway, with deeply recessed 
mouldings and shafts, and with a bold dog-tooth ornament, each projection 
of which is elegantly carved into four converging fleurs-de-lys, occur 
three lofty windows, the central one taller than those at its 
sides&mdash;all with remarkably bold splays, both internally and 
externally, enriched with shafts and mouldings.&nbsp; The central window 
appears to have been of only one light, though broad, and to have had its 
arch occupied by a foliation of six <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>cusps, and therefore of
seven recesses,&mdash;the foliating spaces being solid.&nbsp; The side 
windows are each of two lights, the principal arch-head being solid, but 
pierced with a single aperture divided into six foliations.&nbsp; Above 
these three windows runs a kind of framework, analagous in some respects to
that at the eastern end of the choir.&nbsp; The gable is pierced above 
these windows with a small but beautiful wheel-window of eight pointed 
compartments, each trifoliated; the divisions being moulded in one order, 
and converging to a central ring, itself pierced to admit the light.&nbsp; 
Above all is a square quatrefoliated aperture in the very apex of the 
gable.&nbsp; On the external face of the western end are two bold 
buttresses of a single stage, that on the south-eastern side being pierced 
with loopholes for a circular staircase formed in the thickness of itself 
and the wall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Abbey of Valle Crucis was dissolved in the year 1535, and is said to
have been the first of the Welsh monasteries which underwent the doom of 
abolition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romantic Abbey! hallow&rsquo;d be the rest<br />
Of those, who rear&rsquo;d thee in this wild green vale<br />
A temple lovely as the place is blest&mdash;<br />
And stern as beautiful:&mdash;but words would fail<br />
To paint thy ruin&rsquo;d glories, though the gale<br />
Of desolation sweeps thro&rsquo; thy hoar pile,<br />
And waves the long grass thro&rsquo; thy cloisters pale<br />
Where the dark ivy scorns day&rsquo;s garish smile,<br />
And weed-grown fragments crown thy desecrated aisle.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>* 
* * *</p>
<p>How sweet the sounds!&mdash;whose soft enchantments rose<br />
&rsquo;Mid those wild woodlands at the matin prime&mdash;<br />
Or when the vesper song at evening&rsquo;s close<br />
Wafted the soul beyond the cares of time,<br />
To that Elysium of a brighter clime<br />
Where thro&rsquo; heaven&rsquo;s portals golden vistas gleam,<br />
And the high harps of Seraphim sublime<br />
Came o&rsquo;er the spirit like a prophet&rsquo;s dream,<br />
Till faded earth away on glory&rsquo;s endless beam.</p>
<p>Oft the proud feudal chief, whom human law<br />
Or kingly pow&rsquo;r could bind not, nor control,<br />
Has paus&rsquo;d before thy gates in holy awe,<br />
And felt religion&rsquo;s charm subdue his soul&mdash;<br />
The heart that joy&rsquo;d to hear the savage howl<br />
Of battle on the breeze, has soften&rsquo;d been&mdash;<br />
List&rsquo;ning the hymns of peace that sweetly stole<br />
O&rsquo;er this lone vale, where fancy&rsquo;s eye hath seen<br />
Forms bright and angel-like glide thro&rsquo; thy vistas green:</p>
<p>And angel forms here at thy altar knelt,<br />
Fair dames, and gentle maidens whose bright eyes<br />
The sternest heart of warrior-mould could melt,<br />
Soft&rsquo;ning grim war with gen&rsquo;rous sympathy&mdash;<br />
Pleading, like pity wafted from the skies<br />
To quell the stormy rage of savage man:<br />
And hence the gentle manners had their rise&mdash;<br />
Hence knights for lady&rsquo;s praise all dangers ran&mdash;<br />
And thus, the glorious age of chivalry began.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Abbey derives its name (the Vale of the Cross) from a sepulchral 
monument commonly called &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Pillar of 
Eliseg</span>,&rdquo; which stands on <!-- page 63--><a 
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>an ancient tumulus in 
the middle of this beautifully secluded glen.&nbsp; It was erected by 
Cyngen ab Cadell Dryrnllug, in memory of his great grandfather Eliseg, 
whose son Brochmail Ysgythrog, grandfather of the founder of this rude 
monument of filial veneration, was engaged in the memorable border wars at 
the close of the sixth century; and was defeated at the Battle of Chester, 
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 607.&nbsp; During the great rebellion this 
pillar was thrown down by Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reformers,&rdquo; 
who in their fiery zeal for destruction mistook it for a &ldquo;Popish 
Cross;&rdquo; and it remained for more than a century in its broken 
recumbent condition, when it was restored by the patriotism and 
intelligence of Mr. Lloyd of Trevor Hall, and replaced upon its pedestal 
with a suitable memorial to record the fact.&nbsp; It now forms an 
interesting relic of antiquity, and is probably the oldest British Cross 
(bearing a carved inscription) which exists in these islands.&nbsp; That 
said inscription has long been a puzzle to the learned investigator of 
archaeological remains.</p>
<p>Having wandered through the verdant meads of the &ldquo;happy 
valley,&rdquo; the adventurous tourist may probably wish to climb the lofty
hill, which is crowned by the romantic ruins of the Castle of Dinas 
Bran.&nbsp; This memorable fortress of the past, is a remarkable object 
from all parts of the vale; for whose safety and defence it was long the 
abode of a line of chiefs renowned in Cambrian lore.&nbsp; The view from 
the summit is exceedingly picturesque, <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>grand, and imposing; 
and naturally prompts the exclamation of the Poet of the Seasons&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! what a goodly prospect spreads around.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On descending the mountain-path, the traveller may perchance look round 
for a comfortable resting-place and good refreshment; he will readily find 
both, either at the Hand, or the King&rsquo;s Head Hotel.&nbsp; In the 
album of the latter house of entertainment he may also peruse the following
bacchanalian effusion in honour of &ldquo;Llangollen Ale,&rdquo; which he 
will then be in the mood to enjoy; and as he quaffs this nectar of the 
valley, he may thus chaunt its praises, if in a convivial humour, to the 
music of a Welsh harp&mdash;</p>
<h3>LLANGOLLEN ALE.</h3>
<p>While other poets loudly rant<br />
&nbsp;  About Llangollen&rsquo;s Vale,<br />
Let me, with better taste, descant<br />
&nbsp;  Upon Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>The daughters of the place are fair,<br />
&nbsp;  Its sons are strong and hale:<br />
What makes them so?&nbsp; Llangollen air?<br />
&nbsp;  No, no!&mdash;Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>And Nature only beautified<br />
&nbsp;  The landscape, to prevail<br />
On travellers to turn aside<br />
&nbsp;  And quaff Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>For though the scene might please at first<br />
&nbsp;  As charms would quickly stale;<br />
While he who tastes will ever thirst<br />
&nbsp;  To drink Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>From rock to rock the Dee may roam,<br />
&nbsp;  And chafe without avail;<br />
It cannot match its yeasty foam<br />
&nbsp;  Against Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>The umber-tinted trees that crown<br />
&nbsp;  Bron-vawr&rsquo;s ridge are pale,<br />
Contrasted with the nutty brown<br />
&nbsp;  That tints Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>Nor is the keep of Dinas-bran,<br />
&nbsp;  Though high and hard to scale,<br />
So elevated as the man<br />
&nbsp;  Who drinks Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>Thy shattered arch, beside the way,<br />
&nbsp;  Val-crucis, tells a tale<br />
Of monks who sometimes went astray<br />
&nbsp;  To quaff Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>And still upon the saintly spot<br />
&nbsp;  The pilgrim may regale<br />
His fainting spirits with a pot<br />
&nbsp;  Of good Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>For though the ancient portress may<br />
&nbsp;  Not offer it for sale,<br />
Yet cheerfully to all who pay<br />
&nbsp;  She gives Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>And, Eliseg, thy pillar rude<br />
&nbsp;  Is merely&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be bail&mdash;<br />
A monument to him who brewed<br />
&nbsp;  The first Llangollen Ale.</p>
<p>In short, each ruin, stream, or tree,<br />
&nbsp;  Within Llangollen&rsquo;s Vale,<br />
Where&rsquo;er I turn, whate&rsquo;er I see,<br />
&nbsp;  Is redolent of Ale.</p>

<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>The convivial disposition of the monks of the &ldquo;olden 
time&rdquo; has always been a favourite theme with our romance writers and 
&ldquo;ballad-mongers;&rdquo; but it would appear from a passage which Mr. 
Roscoe quotes, that the cowled brethren of Valle Crucis Abbey did not 
content themselves in their hours of festivity with draughts of 
&ldquo;Llangollen Ale.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wealth of the institution, he 
infers, may be judged of by the magnificent hospitality of the monks, who 
are described by Owain as having the table usually covered with four 
courses of meat, served up in silver dishes, with sparkling claret for 
their general beverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many have told of the monks of old,<br />
&nbsp;  What a saintly race they were;<br />
But &rsquo;tis most true, that a merrier crew<br />
&nbsp;  Could scarce be found elsewhere;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they sung and laughed,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the rich wine quaffed,<br />
&nbsp;  And lived on the daintiest cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Abbot meek, with his form so sleek,<br />
&nbsp;  Was the heartiest of them all,<br />
And would take his place, with a smiling face,<br />
&nbsp;  When the refection bell would call;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they sung and laughed,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the rich wine quaffed,<br />
&nbsp;  Till they shook the olden hall.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
